=== Alpha Release Notes ===

Please note that due to time constraints on the alpha release, some of the controls of the game have changed from what was written in the user manual. Specifically:

* Use the up, down arrow keys to move the fishing hook. 
* Use the right, left arrow keys to move the fishing boat. 
* The fishing hook can catch only 1 fish, and you must raise it to the surface, whether or not you caught the fish you wanted.
* If the fish you caught has a correct word for the given sentence, then a blank will be filled in. If the fish you caught has an incorrect word, then nothing happens. 
* If the fishing hook touches an electric eel, you lose a life and the fishing hook goes back to the surface.
* If you run out of lives, the game stops running and you must close the window and restart to try again.
