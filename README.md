# WhatsTheCatch
Engr100 Project  &lt;3

=== Alpha Release Notes ===

To run the game, run Tester.py in Eclipse

Please note that due to time constraints on the alpha release, some of the controls of the game have changed from what was written in the user manual. Specifically:

* Use the up, down arrow keys to move the fishing hook. 
* Use the right, left arrow keys to move the fishing boat. 
* The fishing hook can catch only 1 fish, and you must raise it to the surface, whether or not you caught the fish you wanted.
* If the fish you caught has a correct word for the given sentence, then a blank will be filled in. If the fish you caught has an incorrect word, then nothing happens. 
* If the fishing hook touches an electric eel, you lose a life and the fishing hook goes back to the surface.
* If the fishing line touches an electric eel, you lose a life and the fishing hook goes back to the surface.
* If you run out of lives, the game stops running and you must close the window and restart to try again.

=== Beta Release Notes ===
To run the game, import the project into Eclipse, and run Menu.py

* All Alpha Release controls still apply (up, down, right left arrow keys) 
* Attractive graphics
* Menu with instructions
* More sentences (if you're bored, feel free to make your own in sample.txt, but follow the formatting correctly - note: if the game crashes because you misformatted a sentence, it's not our fault)
* You get 50 points per correct word
* You get an additional 25 points per sentence that is completed
* You lose 50 points per incorrect word
* If you catch an incorrect fish (bring it to the surface), you'll hear an awful sound
* If you hook a fish you don't want, press SPACE to release it
* If you catch a correct fish, you'll hear a pleasing sound
* If an eel hits your fishing line or hook, you'll hear an electric sound
* As you complete more sentences, the fish and eels will move faster
* If you do catch too many incorrect fish, we feel sorry for you, and eventually, there will only be correct fish left for you to catch
* If you lose all three of your lives, the game ends, and you will be offered to return to the main menu. There, if you click "Play Game," the game will restart
* If the game is still going on and you exit the game screen, it will pause and bring you back to the main menu. You can resume your game by clicking "Play Game"
